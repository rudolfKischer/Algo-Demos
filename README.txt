This is a project meant to explore what I have learnt in my algorithms class. 
This also functions as a website to develop my JS skills with.
Another function will be as notebook or museum on various algorthms.

I plan to have algorthms demonstrated for:

-sorting
-pathfinding
-simple graphics

I might add other sections for algorithms that are less visual:

-Divide and Conqouer
-Dynamic programming
-Trees and tree like structures
-compression
-Graphs
